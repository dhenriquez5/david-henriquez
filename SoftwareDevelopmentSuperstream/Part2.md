- Is important be a leader, and get this role, specially in mommento the team or organization has to decide, what to do, and what not to do

- One of things the company or organization expect when you are a senior, is that you have to be more autonomous

- Probably you are not working as part of the team anymore, maybe you have be a leader of differnts groups teams, even could be outside of the teams meetings, so the question is how do you know what's going on

## How to track the progress of your goals

- could split in quarters as milestones, and keep spliting even weekly, so can be easier to estimate tasks, and have a more accuarte scope of what can be done in this quarter

- remember be adaptable, because changes are there, and always can happend

## About coding, what's going on in this part?
